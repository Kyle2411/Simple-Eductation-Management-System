The JUnit would not work, I kept getting this error, so the test would never run

/*
C:\Users\ben_1\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\12.4\executor-snippets\junit.xml:187: The following error occurred while executing this line:

C:\Users\ben_1\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\12.4\executor-snippets\junit.xml:164: Java returned: 8
*/

I still wrote the code for it anyway, but I'm not 100 percent sure if it works because it would not run.
